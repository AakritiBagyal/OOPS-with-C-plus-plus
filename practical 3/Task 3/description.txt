In this task we have to figure out when upon declaring a character data type variable 'a', we try to input '7457' and while printing the same gives out '7' only.
Part 1 shows above condition.
Part 2 explains the correct way it is implemented when we have to input multiple characters in the variable.
cin() function only takes first character of the string. In order to counter this problem, we use getline function.
