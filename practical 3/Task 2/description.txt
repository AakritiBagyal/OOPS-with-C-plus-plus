This code shows output when the header file <iostream> is written as <iostream.h>
The output gives error as no such file or directory, this is because "iostream.h" is deprecated and not a standard header. It was used in older programs before
C++ was standardized, functions like cout were defined inside iostream.h.
After C++ got standardized, all these functions like cout got moved into the std namespace. To adjust to this change, non .h versions of some of these headers were 
introduced and declared as standard headers.
